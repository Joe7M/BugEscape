# Bug Escape

You control a little bug on its way home. Unfortunately the world is dangerous. Traps are everywhere. When the little bug falls into a trap a precious life is lost. But the little bug is not helpless. It has a sixth sense telling him how many traps are in his surrounding. But it does not know where the traps are located. Logic will help you to navigate the bug to the exit. Use as less steps as possible to get as much points as possible.

Controls:

- ARROW keys for walking
- SPACE to place a danger sign
- ESC to escape.
